Quick fix for OSX:

Download Adobe Air: http://airdownload.adobe.com/air/mac/download/13.0/AdobeAIR.dmg

then replace the installed files to your LoL direotry (dunno where cause i cant get internet to work on my OSX installation)

then download https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/sites/default/files/software_releases/mac/tbb42_20140122oss_osx_0.tgz and replace the tbb file in the game_sln directory with the one that comes in this zip.

or compile the latest tbb file from here https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/sites/default/files/software_releases/source/tbb42_20140310oss_src.tgz

Same with this file: http://developer.download.nvidia.com/cg/Cg_3.1/Cg-3.1_April2012.dmg

That's a manual fix for OSX atm.
